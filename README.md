# SVC_Heatmap_PCA

Exercise 1
  
  Use PCA to find the features with the greatest variation in PC1 and PC2. Draw a heatmap. Using only these two features perform a multi-class
  classification (3 classes in particular: Muffin, Cupcake, Scone) using a SVC. Predict to which
  class they belong the following components: [0, 5], [0, 20], [0, 15], [6, 0], [5, 50]

Exercise 2

  use PCA to find the features with the greatest variation in PC1 and PC2. Draw a heatmap. Using only these two features perform a binary classification
  (2 classes in particular: Muffin and Cupcake) using a SVC. Predict to which class they belong
  the following components: [0, 5], [0, 20], [0, 15], [6, 0], [5, 50]
